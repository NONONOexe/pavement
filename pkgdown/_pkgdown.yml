- title: Geospatial data manipulation
  desc: >
    Geospatial data provides insights into spatial events such as disasters and
    crimes through their relationships. These functions facilitate the
    retrieval and conversion data from OpenStreetMap and other external sources,
    enabling you to begin your spatial analysis.

  - fetch_roads
  - transform_coordinates
  - create_bbox
  - create_bbox_km_cartesian
  - convert_bbox
  - create_osm_roads

- title: Network operations

- subtitle: Network creation
  desc: >
    A road network represents a system of interconnected roads, where
    intersections act as nodes and road segments act as links.
    `create_road_network` constructs a road network from road data.
    For more detailed analysis and visualization, there is also a function,
    `create_segmented_network` or `spatiotemporal_network`,
    to create a segmented road network.

  - segmented_network
  - spatiotemporal_network
  - plot.road_network

- subtitle: Network information retrieval
  desc: >
    These functions provide tools to extract specific information from a road
    network, enabling you to understand the network structure and relationships.
  contents:
  - get_connected_links

- subtitle: Network building utilities
  desc: >
    These functions provide tools to create and manipulate road networks.
  contents:
  - create_graph
  - extract_road_network_nodes
  - extract_road_network_links
  - extract_segmented_network_nodes
  - extract_segmented_network_links
  - extract_road_endpoints
  - extract_road_intersections
  - generate_ids

- title: Segmented network analysis
  desc: >
    Analyzing events on segmented road networks can provide valuable insights
    into spatial relationships and patterns. By assigning events to network
    links and leveraging the detailed network structure, you can identify areas
    with high event frequency with these functions.
  contents:
  - spatiotemporal_events
  - durations
  - set_events
  - find_duration
  - convolute_segmented_network
  - starts_with("compute_")
  - create_line_graph

- title: Spatio-temporal segmented network analysis
  desc: >
    Functions for identifying and testing spatio-temporal clusters,
    such as hotspots, using methods like Local Moran's I and TNKDE.
  contents:
  - convolute_spatiotemporal_network
  - calculate_local_moran
  - plot.spatiotemporal_network
  - plot_local_moran
  - run_consistency_test
  - test_spatio_properties

- title: Geometry manipulation
  desc: >
    Geometric operations are essential for spatial analysis. These functions
    are helpers for working with sf functions, allowing you to create, modify,
    and decompose geometries such as points, linestrings, and polygons.
  contents:
  - create_coordinates
  - create_points
  - create_linestring
  - create_polygon
  - filter_and_cast_geometries
  - sample_points_along_linestring
  - filter_points_within_tolerance
  - remove_points_near_endpoints
  - decompose_linestring
  - split_linestrings

- title: Sample data
  desc: >
    Pre-generated sample datasets related to roads and accidents.
    These datasets can be used to immediately begin using pavement.
  contents:
  - sample_roads
  - sample_accidents
  - sample_accidents_multiyear
  - osm_highway_values
  - jdg2011_datum
