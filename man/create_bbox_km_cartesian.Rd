\title{Create a bounding box from center coordinates and distance in km}
\usage{
create_bbox_km_cartesian(center_lon, center_lat, width_km, height_km)
}
\arguments{
\item{center_lon}{Center longitude (degrees)}

\item{center_lat}{Center latitude (degrees)}

\item{width_km}{Width of the rectangle in km (East-West)}

\item{height_km}{Height of the rectangle in km (North-South)}
}
\value{
A 2x2 matrix representing the bounding box
}
\description{
Calculates a rectangular bounding box based on a central coordinate and
physical dimensions in kilometers. Uses a Cartesian (UTM) projection to
compute offsets and returns the bounding box in WGS84 as a 2x2 matrix.
}
\examples{
# Create a 6.5 km × 4.5 km bounding box centered around Nagoya
bbox <- create_bbox_km_cartesian(
  center_lon = 136.9,
  center_lat = 35.17,
  width_km   = 6.5,
  height_km  = 4.5
)
